Introduction
============

This guide shows the basic steps to process VISIR-NEAR data with PynPoint. First we describe the steps required to install PynPoint.  After that, the basic steps how to get PCA working with PynPoint are shown. Python version 3 is used.

Please also cite `Amara & Quanz (2012) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012MNRAS.427..948A>`_ as the origin of PynPoint, which focused initially on the use of principal component analysis (PCA) as a PSF subtraction method. In case you use specifically the PCA-based background subtraction module or the wavelet based speckle suppression module, please give credit to `Hunziker et al.
