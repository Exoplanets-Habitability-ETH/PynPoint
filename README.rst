PynPoint
=============================

PynPoint is python package for analysing exo-planet imaging data. This relies on a collecting data using a method know as angular differential imaging (ADI). When trying to image (i.e. take a photograph of) planets around the basic a nearby star, the basic idea is to take many many (typical several thousand) images of the star and to process the data using statistical methods to remove the light from the star and thereby reveal the companion planet.

The PynPoint package has been developed at ETH Zurich as a collaboration between the |SPF_link| and the |Cosmo_link| of the |Astro|. Details of the methodology behind PynPoint can be found in |Method|. The package was further developed, with support of the |SoftwareLab|, and is now publicly available. Further information on the package can also be found in our code description paper.
