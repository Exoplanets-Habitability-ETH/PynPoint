PynPoint
=============================

PynPoint is a python package for analysing exo-planet imaging data. When trying to image planets around a nearby star, the basic idea is to take many, typically several thousands, of frames and to process the data using statistical methods. The aim is to remove the light from the star, so as to reveal the companion planet.

The PynPoint package has been developed at ETH Zurich as a collaboration between the |SPF_link| and the |Cosmo_link| of the |Astro|. Details of the methodology behind PynPoint can be found in |Method|. The package was further developed, with the support of the |SoftwareLab|, and is now publicly available. Further information on the package can also be found in our code description paper.
