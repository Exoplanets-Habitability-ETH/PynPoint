PynPoint
=============================

PynPoint is python package for analysing exo-planet imaging data. This relies on a collecting data using a method know as angular differential imaging (ADI). When trying to image (i.e. take a photograph of) planets around aThe basic a nearby star, the basic idea is to take many many (typical several thousand) images of the star and to process the data using statistical methods to remove the light from the star and thereby reveal the companion planet.

Finding exo-planets in this way is challanging and requires the use of the state of the art telescopes and the developement of new analysis methods for processing the data.

The PynPoint package has been developed at ETH Zurich as a collaboration between `the star and planet formation group <http://www.astro.ethz.ch/meyer>`_ and `the cosmology reseach group <http://www.astro.ethz.ch/refregier>`_ of `the institute of astronomy <http://www.astro.ethz.ch>`_. Details of the methodoloy behind PynPoint can be found in `our method paper <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012MNRAS.427..948A>`_. The package is was further developed, with support of the `Software Lab of the cosmology group <http://www.astro.ethz.ch/refregier/research/Software>`_, and is now publically available. Further information on the package can also be found our code description paper.
