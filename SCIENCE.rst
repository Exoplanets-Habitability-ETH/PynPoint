PynPoint has already been demostrated on data and has been used to find exo-planet systems. We will try to maintain a list of such systems. If you find intersting objects in your data that you would like us to list please email the PynPoint team.

PynPoint Results
----------------



1) Beta Pictoris b - a young gas giant planet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In our first PynPoint paper, where we presented the PSF modeling approach based on principal component analysis, we used publicly available data of the exoplanet beta Pictoris b to demonstrate the power of PynPoint. The final image of the exoplanet, a detailed description of the data and all relevant references can be found in |Method|.

2) HD100546 b - a planet in formation?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first new science result from PynPoint was the discovery of a protoplanet candidate embedded in the protoplanetary disk around the young, intermediate mass star HD100546. The brightness and morphology of the object suggest that HD100546 b might be a gas giant planet that is still in the process of formation. If confirmed, it would be the first time such an object was directly imaged. See the |HD100546b| for more details.

3) HD95086 b - detection and confirmation of a 4-5 Jupiter mass planet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PynPoint was used in the discovery and later in the confirmation of HD95086 b, which is, together with GJ 504 b, probably the lowest mass exoplanet ever imaged around a nearby star. The two papers can be found |Confirmation| and |Detection|.
